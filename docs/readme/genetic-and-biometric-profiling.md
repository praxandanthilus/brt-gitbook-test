### 1. Trait Identification

* **Objective**: Pinpoint the most desirable superhuman traits‚Äîstrength, speed, regeneration, and maybe a dash of telepathy for awkward meetings.
* **Sources**:
  * DNA samples from metahumans (voluntary or... ‚Äúarchived‚Äù).
  * Combat performance logs and biometric scans.
  * If they survived a nuke and still made it to brunch, we want their genes.

### 2. Genomic Analysis

* **Tools**: Whole genome sequencing, AI pattern recognition, and a coffee-fueled intern named Max.
* **Goal**: Isolate gene clusters responsible for powers. Bonus points if they don‚Äôt cause spontaneous combustion.
* **Example**: Mutations in _ACTN3_ for muscle performance‚Äîor _X-Men_ genes if we ever find them.

### 3. Trait Optimization

* **Process**:
  * Simulate edits using CRISPR-like tech.
  * Predict outcomes with AI models trained on ethically questionable datasets.
  * Remove instability unless it‚Äôs useful in combat.

### 4. Biometric Compatibility Mapping

* **Purpose**: Ensure the genome won‚Äôt turn the host into a puddle.
* **Checks**:
  * Hormonal balance
  * Neural integration
  * Cardiovascular tolerance (especially under stress, like being shot at)

### 5. Blueprint Design

* **Output**: A digital genome tailored for powers, adaptability, and psychological resilience.
* **Customization**: Add underwater breathing, night vision, or the ability to sit through corporate briefings without blinking.

### 6. Ethical & Control Layering

* **Optional**: Embed loyalty triggers or biochemical dependencies.
* **Examples**:
  * Genes that activate under LutherCorp command phrases.
  * A built-in need for LutherCorp‚Äôs proprietary enzyme‚Äîavailable in convenient weekly doses.
