## 🛑 Weaknesses & Exploits

> ⚠️ _Confidential: For containment and narrative balance only_

### 1. **Kryptonite**
- **Origin:** Radioactive fragments of Krypton.
- **Types:**
  - **Green:** Drains power, causes cellular degradation, extreme pain.
  - **Red:** Causes unpredictable mutations or personality changes.
  - **Gold:** Permanently removes powers by altering solar absorption.
- **Exploit:** Embed in weapons, atmosphere dispersal, or surgically implant via magic.

### 2. **Red Sun Radiation**
- Kryptonian physiology depends on yellow sunlight.
- Red solar exposure reverts Superman to a normal Kryptonian baseline.
- **Exploit:** Use red sun lamps, gravity chambers, or orbital red sun filters.

### 3. **Magic**
- Not a vulnerability per se, but Superman has no innate resistance to magical forces.
- **Exploit:** Enchant weapons or traps with mystic runes; use sorcerers or magical artifacts.

### 4. **Psychic Manipulation**
- Moderate resistance, but vulnerable to high-level telepaths (e.g. Martian Manhunter).
- **Exploit:** Use psionic dampeners or coordinate with mind-control specialists.

### 5. **Moral Code**
- Superman will not kill. He will prioritize innocents above his own safety.
- **Exploit:** Use hostages, distraction tactics, or force him into no-win scenarios.

### 6. **Lead**
- Blocks X-ray vision.
- **Exploit:** Use lead-lined walls, containers, or armor to conceal actions or traps.

### 7. **Emotional Vulnerabilities**
- Protective of Lois Lane, the Kent family, and the Justice League.
- Can experience guilt, grief, and PTSD from past failures (e.g., Doomsday, Krypton’s destruction).
- **Exploit:** Psychological manipulation, illusions, or memory-based attacks (e.g. Scarecrow toxin).

## 🧪 Containment Protocols (Theoretical)

- **Environment:** Red sun chamber with Kryptonite-laced atmosphere.
- **Restraints:** Magic-forged bindings (e.g., forged by Hephaestus or Doctor Fate).
- **Surveillance:** 24/7 satellite tracking; monitor solar flare activity and psychological profiles.
- **Failsafe:** Phantom Zone projector under biometric lock and Justice League consensus.
